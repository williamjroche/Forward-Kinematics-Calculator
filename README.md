# Forward-Kinematics-Transformation-Matrices-Calculator

Overview: 
This is a python program that calculates the Transformation Matrices for a given table of link parameters.

Usage: 
In order to make this useful for yourself, you need to change the "dh" array. This array represents the table of link parameters and needs to be updated to find transformation matrices for your own values. However, there are values already loaded and you can simply run the file in order to see how the program works.

Note:
Floating point values will be seen in the range of e^-17. These values should be treated as 0.
