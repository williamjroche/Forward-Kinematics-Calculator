# Forward Kinematics Calculator

Overview: 
-------------------
This is a python program that calculates the Transformation Matrices for a given dh table.

Usage: 
------------------
In order to make this useful for yourself, you need to change the "dh" array. This array represents the table of link parameters and needs to be updated to find transformation matrices for your own values. However, there are values already loaded based off of the PUMA 560 robot and you can simply run the file in order to see how the program works.
